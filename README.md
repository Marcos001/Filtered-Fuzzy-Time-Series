# Filtered Fuzzy Time Series
This project brings a new fuzzy time series model for the task of regression in time series that have great influences of stochastic components. The developed model was compared with the state of the art and achieved superior results. For more information, see the article [Using fuzzy clustering to address imprecision and uncertainty present in deterministic components of time series](xxx).

The main contribution of this work is focused on automatically modeling the fuzzification stage, by pre-processing the series, and eliminating noise and components of high frequency with low information.

Application of the model in the financial series TAIEX 1992 in (A), and in (B) the graphical display of the DTW metric to exemplify the alignment of the series with the prediction of the FTS model.



### Illustrative Example

#### Decomposition with Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD)

```python
# decomposition: apply EMD to get IMFs
emd = EMD()
imfs = emd.emd(time_series)
```

### Select deterministic components

```python
# Select MFIs without trending and noise behavior 
deterministic_time_series = imfs[1]+imfs[2]
```



#### Apply in model to fit and forecasting

```python
from FTS.Models.MV_Chen import STFMV_Convencional_Chen

fuzzy_sets = 7

model = STFMV_Convencional_Chen()
model.fit(X=[[time_series, deterministic_time_series]], k=fuzzy_sets)
model.predict()
```
