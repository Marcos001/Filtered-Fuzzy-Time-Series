# Filtered Fuzzy Time Series
This project brings a fuzzy time series model for the task of regression in time series that have great influences of stochastic components. The developed model was compared with the state of the art and achieved superior results. For more information, see the article [Using fuzzy clustering to address imprecision and uncertainty present in deterministic components of time series](xxx).
